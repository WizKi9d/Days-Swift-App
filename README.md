# Days-Swift-App
SwiftUI app, Days. A-level Coursework.

My app follows previously thought of apps for typical lazy students and makes revision a necesitiy. 

Days is the app that simply adds a todo list for the user and an activities list. The activities list holds 
either a simple activity or revision time. If its revision time, on the time set all apps on the users phone
will be locked until the revision time is over. The app forces revision time on you by placing it
at times where you're free. It forces revision on you!

------ To Do List: ------

-- Quick to do's --

Fix delete button
Fix button sizing
Fix scrolling on activities page

-- Major Updates to finish --
Lock apps on users phone until the time is up.
Add forced revision times
Set app to always be running in the background after opening
